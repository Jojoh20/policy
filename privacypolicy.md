# Privacy Policy for the Flutter Release Test App

Last updated: June 12, 2025

Johannes Hafner ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Flutter Release Test App (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our App during internal testing.

## Information We Collect
- **Camera Access**: The App requests access to your device’s camera to perform a Camera Test, which ensures the correct functionality of the app. Camera data is processed locally on your device and is not stored, shared, or transmitted to any external servers.
- **No Other Personal Information**: The App does not collect other personal information, such as your name, email address, or location.

## How We Use Your Information
- Camera data is used solely to enable the App’s testing features and is not used for any other purpose.
- No data is shared with third parties, and no data is stored after you close the App.

## Data Storage and Security
- Camera data is processed in real-time and not stored on your device or our servers.
- We implement reasonable measures to protect your data, but no method is 100% secure.

## Third-Party Services
- The App does not use third-party services that collect or process personal data.

## Your Data Rights
- Since no personal data is collected or stored, there are no data deletion or access requests applicable. If you have questions, contact us at johannes.hafner2@gmail.com.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
- We may update this policy if the App’s functionality changes. Updates will be posted at this URL.

## Contact Us
- For questions, contact Johannes Hafner at johannes.hafner2@gmail.com.

This policy complies with Google Play’s requirements for apps in internal testing.
